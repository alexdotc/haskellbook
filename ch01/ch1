CHAPTER EXERCISES

Combinators

1. lambda x: xxx is a combinator
2. lambda xy: zx is not a combinator since z is a free variable
3. lambda xyz: xy(zx) is a combinator
4. lambda xyz: xy(zxy) is a combinator
5. lambda xy: xy(zxy) is not a combinator since z is a free variable

Normal form or diverge?

1. lambda x: xxx is already in normal form
2. (lambda z: zz)(lambda y: yy) becomes (lambda y: yy)(lamda y: yy) which is 
   alpha equivalent and diverges
3. (lambda x: xxx)z reduces to normal form zzz
